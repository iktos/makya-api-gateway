# Makya Api Gateway

## Getting started

1. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env``
2. Set the environment value as need (Contact Iktos to get the Authentication Token and URL)
3. Edit the `acl.yaml` to register your APIs. A sample API is provided as an example (see note below)
4. (Optional) If you don't wish to use ACL files, edit the docker-compose file to remove the mounted volume
5. Run the API Gateway with the command `docker compose up`


## Example API

This package is distributed with an example API that computes the SA Score value.
The source code of the API can be found and rebuilt from [here](https://github.com/iktos/makya-api-sa-score)

It can be safely removed from the compose file if not needed.
